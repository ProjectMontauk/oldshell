              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Who Are Superforecasters?</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                &quot;Superforecaster&quot; is a term coined by psychologist Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers. It grew out of the Good Judgment Project. The Good Judgment Project was the winning entry in IARPA&apos;s Aggregative Contingent Estimation tournament, a multi-year competition run by the US intelligence community to find the most accurate forecasting method available. Superforecasters emerged as the clear winner. They are qualified by proven performance, not by title. Every forecast they make is scored against a real-world outcome. Their edge is not opinion. It is measured, repeated, and public.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">A Track Record That Consistently Beats the Competition</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Superforecasters do not just forecast well. They consistently outperform every other established method of intelligence gathering.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>They beat classified intelligence.</strong> In the original IARPA tournament, superforecasters were found to be 30% more accurate than intelligence analysts working with access to classified information. The finding rocked conventional wisdom across the intelligence community.</li>
                <li><strong>They beat prediction markets.</strong> Across several tournament seasons, superforecaster forecasts outperformed live prediction markets tracking the same questions.</li>
                <li><strong>They beat AI.</strong> In July 2026, the Financial Times tested a leading AI forecasting model against the market on Federal Reserve rate decisions. The AI model matched the market but never beat it. It could not reproduce the judgment that sets superforecasters apart: knowing when to step away from the crowd. When Silicon Valley Bank failed in 2023 and markets swung sharply toward a Fed policy pivot, superforecasters saw no real signal and barely moved their forecast. They were right. The market corrected its overreaction later.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                This makes superforecasters uniquely suited to power a price oracle. They carry a demonstrated record of outperforming classified intelligence, open markets, and now AI, across decades of real-world tests.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Why They&apos;re Qualified</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Forecast accuracy is measured with the Brier score. It captures the gap between a forecaster&apos;s stated probability and the actual outcome. A score of 0 is perfect. A score of 2 is the worst possible result. Superforecasters posted an average Brier score of roughly 0.166 across tournament seasons. The broader forecaster pool averaged about 0.259. That gap holds across hundreds of real-world geopolitical and economic questions. It is the foundation of their qualification: demonstrated calibration rather than credentials alone.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">How They&apos;re Vetted</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Good Judgment&apos;s vetting process is rigorous, and the SBI panel draws on the same standard.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Minimum sample size.</strong> A forecaster must answer at least 50 questions within a tournament season before becoming eligible. This rules out a lucky streak.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy threshold.</strong> Superforecaster status goes to roughly the top 2% of forecasters by average accuracy score within that season.</li>
                <li><strong>Qualitative review.</strong> Good Judgment also reviews comment quality and collegiality. Reasoning matters as much as the number itself. Superforecasters work in small teams, and their rationale is delivered to clients alongside every probability.</li>
                <li><strong>Re-qualification.</strong> Status is not permanent. Track record is re-evaluated every season. Underperformance can cost a forecaster their status. The SBI panel applies this same relegation logic internally.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">How Many Superforecasters Are Used</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Good Judgment Inc. maintains an active pool of roughly 180 professional superforecasters. They are drawn from a base of over 100,000 forecasters who have taken part in the original tournament and its successor, Good Judgment Open.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                (Note: insert the number of superforecasters the SBI panel itself draws on. I don&apos;t have that figure for The Citizen&apos;s panel.)
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Good Judgment&apos;s Aggregation Methodology</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Good Judgment does not average forecasts naively. Its method is often called elitist aggregation, and it combines two steps.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Weighting.</strong> Each forecaster&apos;s input is weighted by track record and by recency. A better track record earns more weight. A recently updated forecast earns more weight than a stale one.</li>
                <li><strong>Extremizing.</strong> The weighted average is then pushed further toward 0 or 1 than a simple average would suggest. This corrects a known bias: forecasters&apos; private information overlaps only partially, so a plain average tends to land closer to 50% than the group&apos;s true collective knowledge supports. The larger and more diverse the forecaster pool, the further the aggregate can safely be pushed toward certainty.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                This weighted and extremized approach beat simple averaging, unweighted medians, and in several tournament years, live prediction markets, inside IARPA&apos;s tournament. The SBI methodology follows the same model. Individual superforecaster estimates are weighted by track record and recency, then extremized, to produce the published index value.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">How It Works</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Superforecasters on the price oracle are ranked annually by unlevered profit and loss (P&amp;L) across every market they trade. At year-end, the bottom quartile by P&amp;L is removed from the price oracle and replaced by qualified challenger forecasters carrying the strongest P&amp;L track records. It functions like a promotion/relegation system: a seat on the price oracle is earned and re-earned every year, so the panel continuously selects for the traders who price uncertainty most accurately and update fastest on new evidence. Over time, this continuous selection process means the price oracle comes to represent the market consensus of the best people in the world at anticipating which facts or stories are true or false.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Worked Example: &quot;Did Mark Kill Peter?&quot;</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Consider a contested-claims market: Did Mark kill Peter? The YES contract opens trading at 5¢ (a 5% implied probability), reflecting thin initial evidence.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Investigators later disclose that a rag stained with Peter&apos;s blood was found in the trunk of Mark&apos;s car. The market reacts immediately, and YES rises from 5¢ to 90¢ as calibrated forecasters update toward Mark&apos;s guilt.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-6">Three Traders</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Three Superforecasters each trade the market with $1,000 in unlevered capital:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Trader A (&quot;The Skeptic&quot;)</strong>: buys NO early at 95¢/share.</li>
                <li><strong>Trader B (&quot;The Sharp&quot;)</strong>: buys YES early at 5¢/share, before the evidence breaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Trader C (&quot;The Second Mover&quot;)</strong>: buys YES mid-move at 50¢/share, after rumors surface but before the rag is confirmed.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                When the market settles near 90¢ YES (10¢ NO), the results diverge sharply:

              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                A derivative is a financial contract whose value is based on the price of something else. On derp.trade, that &quot;something else&quot; is a token, such as SOL, WIF, or any other Solana token. On The Citizen, the underlying is the probability of a contested claim resolving one way or the other.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                When you trade on The Citizen, you are not buying or selling the underlying claim directly. Instead, you are opening a position that tracks the market&apos;s implied probability:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Long</strong>: you profit if the price goes up.</li>
                <li><strong>Short</strong>: you profit if the price goes down.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                You can use leverage to amplify your position. For example, 10x leverage means a 1% price move gives you a 10% gain (or loss). All positions are denominated in USDT. You deposit USDT as collateral and receive your profits in USDT.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">How Trading Works</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Here is the flow of a typical trade on The Citizen:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Pick a market</strong>: browse the available contested-claims markets on The Citizen.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose long or short</strong>: decide whether you think the implied probability will go up or down.</li>
                <li><strong>Set your position size and leverage</strong>: enter the amount of USDT you want to put up as collateral and choose your leverage multiplier.</li>
                <li><strong>The AMM takes the other side</strong>: derp.trade&apos;s automated market maker fills your order instantly. There is no waiting for a counterparty.</li>
                <li><strong>Your PnL updates in real time</strong>: as the market price moves, your unrealized profit or loss changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Close when you are ready</strong>, or get liquidated if your collateral runs out.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">The AMM: Your Trading Partner</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                On traditional exchanges, you need another person on the other side of your trade. On derp.trade, an automated market maker (AMM) fills that role. The AMM is a smart contract that is always willing to trade with you.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Because the AMM is always available, markets can exist for tokens with low trading volume. There is no minimum liquidity requirement; the AMM handles everything.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The AMM earns trading fees and funding payments, which build up its liquidity over time. The more a market is traded, the deeper its liquidity becomes.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Funding Rates</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                To keep markets balanced, derp.trade uses funding rates. If many more traders are long than short (or vice versa), the majority side pays a small fee to the minority side. This encourages traders to take the less popular side and keeps the market healthy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Funding is charged continuously, every 15 seconds in small amounts. You can see the current funding rate for any market on the trading page before you open a position.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Leverage and Liquidation</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Leverage lets you control a larger position with less collateral. For example, with 10x leverage and 10 USDT of collateral, you control a 100 USDT position.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The tradeoff is risk. Higher leverage means your position gets liquidated more easily. Liquidation happens when your losses eat through your collateral. At that point, the protocol closes your position and you lose your deposited collateral.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Before opening any trade, check your liquidation price, the price at which your position would be liquidated. The trading UI shows this clearly.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">The Science Court Proposal</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Physicist Arthur Kantrowitz first proposed a &quot;Science Court&quot; in 1967. His model separated questions of scientific fact from questions of policy or value. Two case managers, one for each side of a contested issue, would submit statements of fact. A panel of judges, senior scientists with no stake in the outcome, would test each statement through adversarial questioning until it was either accepted or set aside as unresolved. A federal task force reviewed the proposal in 1976, and the idea has since been revived in practice.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Ellad Tadmor at the University of Minnesota runs a modern version called SciCourt, which carries contested public-policy topics through the same structure: pretrial evidence agreement, adversarial presentation, and neutral judgment aimed at building consensus rather than declaring a winner.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                We adapt this same structure to give the SBI panel a formal, recurring check on the claims embedded in its markets.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">The Quarterly Trial Procedure</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Once per quarter, a subset of superforecasters is convened as judges for a given market or cluster of related markets.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-6">Roles</h3>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Judges.</strong> Drawn from the superforecaster panel. To remain neutral, judges may not hold an open position in the market under review and may not have a recent trading history on it.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Managers.</strong> Other superforecasters, assigned as advocates to opposing sides of the contested claim. Each case manager compiles supporting evidence and drafts a prioritized list of the factual statements they want the judges to accept.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-6">Process</h3>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Evidence submission.</strong> Case managers submit their supporting material to the evidence section, along with a prioritized list of the individual factual statements they wish to establish.</li>
                <li><strong>Adversarial questioning.</strong> Judges question each statement directly against the opposing case manager, so weak or unsupported claims are exposed and can be met with counter-evidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Resolution.</strong> Questioning continues until every statement is either accepted as stated, mediated into wording both sides can endorse, or set aside as unresolved. Nothing is silently dropped.</li>
                <li><strong>Final output.</strong> The judges publish a single document containing every accepted or mediated statement, along with a clear record of anything left unresolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Cruxes and new questions.</strong> Alongside the accepted statements, judges identify the cruxes: the specific points where the two sides still disagree and where new evidence would most change the market&apos;s probability. These are published back to the broader panel as new sub-questions that market participants can trade on and use to update their forecasts.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Why This Matters</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                A single probability number can hide which underlying arguments still hold up under scrutiny. The Quarterly Trial forces that disagreement onto the table on a fixed schedule. It converts vague suspicion into named cruxes, and it gives market participants a fresh, testable set of questions instead of requiring them to sift through raw evidence themselves. Over time, this should sharpen the calibration of the underlying market by directing new evidence-gathering toward exactly the claims most likely to move the price.

                Data is not valuable, the truth is. The Citizen is a fact finding and verification platform that crowdsources claims and uses prediction markets to confirm their authenticity.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Market Resolution</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The markets will be resolved by a panel of three neutral judges that have domain expertise. The Citizen that will draft three judges that meet the following criteria:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li>Born in the United States</li>
                <li>Phd. or Phd. candidate in relevant field</li>
                <li>Self-proclaimed neutral and undecided on the particular question at hand</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                To preserve the integrity of the panel, the identity of the judges will never be revealed. This will ensure that the panel is free to make any judgement without fear of backlash. Extraordinary measures will be taken to never reveal the identity of the judges. Judging anonymity may increase the honesty of the traders since they will not be able to guess the biases of the judges based on public information, instead they can only rely on the evidence presented. 
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Judging Incentives</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The Judges will be paid using two different methods.
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li>Each judge will receive a 1% vig on all bets wagered on the market.</li>
                <li>Each judge will collect a $1 royalty on the case summary that will be published at the end of the market. The caveat is that the the royalty payments will stop if their decision is overturned in a later appeals market.</li>
              </ol>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The vig is collected on all trades. If a market does $100,000 in volume, each judge will earn $1,000 from the vig.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                If the case summary sells 1,000 copies at $6 dollar per, each judge will earn $1,000. However if their decision is overturned in an appeals market, then the overturning panel will publish a new paper and the old judges from the overturned decision will not receive any proceeds from the new paper.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Judges are incentivized to make a truthful decision that can withstand scrutiny to preserve their future royalty payments. If the decision succeeds in telling the truth and avoiding appeals courts, the judges can collect royalty payments for eternity. If a paper sells 200,000 copies over its life-time, each judge will earn $200,000. 
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Appeals Markets</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                Each month, the market decision with the highest number of weighted trader votes will be restarted with the evidence section cleared and the market odds set back to 50-50. After the market expires, a new paper will be published by the new set of judges and replace the old case summary. 
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                If the previous decision is upheld, the previous judges and the new judges will split the royalties at $1 per sale and The Citizen will stop receiving royalty payments. If the new judges overturn the previous decision, the previous judges will stop receiving the royalties and the royalties will be split between The Citizen and the new judges.
              </p>
              
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-black font-sans mb-3 mt-10">Citizen Economics</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                The Citizen will lose money on market making. For the initial markets, The Citizen will lose $6,931 on providing initial liquidity and the vig collected from the market will be split amongst the judges. However, The Citizen will take 50% of the royalties from the case summaries. At $6 per case summary, this means that the Citizen needs to sell 2,310 case summaries to break even on the market making. Any case studies sold after the 2,310th will result in the venture being profitable. The Citizen eventually expects to pivot to a subscription model where subscribers will pay $10 per month, but the initial payment model will be based on individual case summaries.

            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
              Idea futures align incentives to surface, evaluate, and fund research on questions that have remained unresolved for decades. By pricing hypotheses and rewarding updates toward truth,
              these markets coordinate attention and capital toward questions that matter. 
              Idea futures markets have two periods during their lifecycle:
            </p>

                The discovery period is the first phase of an idea futures market that runs for a select period of time.
                To start, the discovery period will be 5 months and during this period traders are able to buy/sell shares
                and share information in the evidence section. During the discovery period, the market collects
                all relevant information about each claim and then prices the probability that each claim is true given the information shared.

                The settlement period begins immediately after the discovery period and runs for 
                one month. Like the discovery period, the market remains fully open to buying, 
                selling, and sharing information. The only difference is that during the settlement
                period, the median price is recorded and used to determine the final settlement price of the market.
                After the settlement period ends, the market is resolved and the payouts are distributed to the 
                traders based on the median price recorded during this period.

            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
              A single manipulator attack is conducted by one trader who attempts to distort the
              market price to their advantage. This attack can occur during both the discovery
              and settlement period. However, it is unprofitable for the manipulator to sell their position
              prior to settlement since they would experience normal price slippage. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
              The primary strategy for a manipulator is to buy a large number of shares to increase the median price
              during the settlement period. Once the settlement period ends, the manipulator can redeem their shares at 
              a higher price per share than their average cost per share if they succeed in increasing the median price.

As a result, the median settlement price, represented by med(x) in the payout formula, is the normal pricing function since only the manipulator can affect a price change in the idealized environment:

              To simulate how a manipulator can profit in an unprotected market, let&apos;s set the following market parameters:

              The manipulator is going to buy shares to increase the median price during the settlement period. Since it is an idealized environment,
              there are no other traders in the market so the manipulator will have complete control over the median price. Let&apos;s graph the manipulator&apos;s profits

              When Q₁ and Q₂ are zero, the manipulator will profit any time they buy more than 1279 shares. 
              The manipulator can yield a profit of $5,040 after buying 50,995 shares which means they will drive the Yes market odds from 50% to 99.39%. 
              In an unprotected market, the market is vulnerable to manipulators and the market odds will likely not reflect the geniune beliefs of the traders.

              The inequality above can be proved for all positive values of q1, q2, and x1. Intutively, it makes sense that the normal redemption function is greater than the altered median redemption function since the altered
              median redemption function deducts price slippage, while the normal redemption function redeems the user at the median price during settlement.

              A possible problem with the altered median redemption function is how is the median settlement state determined? 
              At expiration, the market will have a certain purchase state, but traders will redeem their shares based on the median settlement state which is not the same as the purchase state at expiration. 
              As a result, the market maker faces additional potential losses in redemption since the median market state may require more payouts to traders than the purchase state at expiration. This topic will be handled in another paper.

            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-base mb-4">
                There are several mitigations that can be implemented to prevent multiple manipulator attacks:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-800 leading-7 text-base mb-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Max Purchase Limits:</strong> A single trader is only allowed to move the market 10%. The cumulative price impact of their trades will be tracked and no account&apos;s trades can produce a cumulative price impact greater than 10%. This can easily be enforced on the front-end and results in manipulators needing to coordinate with other real identities to carry out attacks. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>KYC (Know Your Customer):</strong> Identity verification that ties each trading account to a real-world identity. KYC makes sybil attacks expensive by requiring manipulators to recruit or procure actual identities rather than creating disposable accounts. This raises the cost of coordination since each participant must be a verified individual. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Median Settlement:</strong> Settlement uses the median price over the last month of the market. 
                This means manipulators need to effect the market odds more than 50% of the time during the settlement period to have any effect on the market. Attempts to manipulate the market odds early in the settlement period provide other traders plenty of time to trade against the manipulators, confusing the desired price movement. 
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Daily Price Change Caps:</strong> A absolute 15% limit on total price change per market day prevents rapid price changes associated with multiple manipulator attacks. This ensures that even well-funded coalitions cannot force prices to extreme levels quickly; instead, they must sustain pressure over multiple days, giving the market time to respond. The daily cap forces manipulators to spread attacks across time, increasing both coordination complexity and the opportunity for detection.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Threat of Fund Seizure:</strong> The possibility of losing funds for coordinated manipulation creates significant deterrent risk. By maintaining the authority to seize or freeze funds associated with suspicious trading patterns, the market creates asymmetric risk for manipulators, who risk losing not just their manipulation profits but their entire capital. This threat, especially when combined with KYC identity verification, makes coordinated attacks financially hazardous beyond just their execution costs.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 text-base mb-4">
              Together, these five measures create friction that makes multiple manipulator attacks significantly more difficult. Coalitions must coordinate real identities, spread purchases across time and accounts, extend attacks over multiple days, and overcome settlement mechanics that average out spiky activity all while facing the threat of fund seizure.

Conversely, market maker losses can be mitigated as a result of using a median market when the median settlement price is below the final market odds on the dominant side of the market:

              The market maker makes $1,008.62 given the market parameters described above. Market making profitably depends entirely on market values but anytime the collected market fees are greater than the redemption loss, the market maker will profit. The smaller the average size of the share holder, the closer the market maker loss will be to the maximum bounded loss in redemption. The market maker profits in redemption from whales since it means that a large percentage of shares are redeemed below market odds.

                Each judge will categorize their final opinion in one of the following buckets:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                <li>No - beyond a reasonable doubt (estimated confidence of 95%)</li>
                <li>No - clear and convincing evidence (estimated confidence of 70%)</li>
                <li>No - inconclusive for both sides (estimated confidence of less than 70%)</li>
                <li>Yes - clear and convincing evidence (estimated confidence of 70%)</li>
                <li>Yes - beyond a reasonable doubt (estimated confidence of 95%)</li>
              </ol>
              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                For the market to resolve &quot;Yes,&quot; two out of three judges need to rule in favor of the &quot;Yes&quot; position, meaning two out of three judges rule either &quot;Yes - clear and convincing evidence&quot; or &quot;Yes - beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; Any time less than two judges rules in favor of the &quot;Yes&quot; position, then the market will resolve &quot;No.&quot;

              <p className="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
                After making their decision, the judges will author a case summary where they will review at least the top ten pieces of evidence promoted in the evidence section for each position. They will comment on the authenticity and truthfulness of each document.
